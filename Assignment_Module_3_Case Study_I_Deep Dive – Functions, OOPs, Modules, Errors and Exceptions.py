1. A Robot moves in a Plane starting from the origin point (0,0). The robot can move
toward UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. The trace of Robot movement is as given following:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
The numbers after directions are steps.  Write a program to compute the distance current position after sequence of movements.
Hint: Use math module.
